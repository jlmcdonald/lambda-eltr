# Description

A lambda function that can be attached to listen to S3 buckets; when files are uploaded to the buckets, they will be pushed by this lambda function into pre-set elastic transcoder pipelines.

# Installation

Set the names of the buckets and the IDs of the pipelines (this should be abstracted soon for easy config)
